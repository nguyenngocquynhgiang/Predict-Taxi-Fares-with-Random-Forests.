# Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests

# Project Description
In this project, you get to work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. You will use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. While not required, it can help to have some extended experience with the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and randomForests.

Project Tasks
1. 49999 New York taxi trips
2. Cleaning the taxi data
3. Zooming in on Manhattan
4. Where does the journey begin?
5. Predicting taxi fares using a tree
6. It's time. More predictors.
7. One more tree!
8. One tree is not enough
9. Plotting the predicted fare
10. Plotting the actual fare
11. Where do people spend the most?
